This is a collection of utilities for generating MODIS/VIIRS refeclatance data.
Generating the entire, 20+ year record takes a long time. They are written
specifically for NCSS/Discover and using its CSS network-attached storage.
They may be useful to the general audience or generalizable, but right now I'm
happy enough that it doesn't reference my nobackup. Note: By default, these
utilities place everything in directories two levels higher. This can be
changed in `setup.sh`.
