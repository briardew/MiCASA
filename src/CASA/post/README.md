This is a set of utilities for publishing the output of MiCASA. They are kept
here as an example, but they have some aspects that are specific to NCCS
Discover and the specific run (viz., resolution). I'm trying my best to make
them modular and adaptable. Long-term they will probably be transitioned to
Python.
