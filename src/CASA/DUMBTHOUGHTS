* Will lose zero diff, esp. when correcting herbivory bug.

1. Check what you have now against existing code
   i.e., all monthly references removed to the point of zero diff
2. Change stuff that relies on entire record to apply to climatology
3. Need to regrid MERRA-2 and save
   * Need to do this because spin-up reads the fields repeatedly (2000 times)

* Spin-up at monthly?

*** Takes 1-3 seconds to read daily MODIS and read/regrid M2 data at 0.1 deg ***
*** 2*365.25 seconds = 13 minutes for 1 year ***
*** 4 hours for 20 years, and 16 days for 2000 years ***
*** > 50% of that time is regrid; we could be smarter, but want change O() ***
*** Long term, will probably want ability to run 1 final spinup at full time/space res ***

So spinup can't just naively step through days because even reading a
climatology for every day would take 16 days to run.
